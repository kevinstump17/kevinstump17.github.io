<p>In mid 1964,the Chevrolet Chevelle was brought to production. The midsied GM A Body platform was intended to compete with Ford Motor Companies <i>Fairlane</i>. The aim at GM was simple: Build a luxury midsized car, that was spirited and fun to drive. Body styles included two door Coupes, Convertibles and Hardtops. Engines ranging from 196ci inline 6's to 283ci V8's were available this year, but It was the 1965 model year where things got crazy. 
The 1965 model year birthed the Big-Block 396ci powered Z-16 trim level. A total of 201 Z-16's were produced, 200 coupes and 1 convertible - creating one of the rarest cars to date. This was Chevy's contribution to the displacement-hungry detroit battle that continued for years to come. The last few years of the First Generation saw the special treatment of the Z-16, but without a limited production run - Fast cars had become the norm.

<p>By 1968 <ins>a lot</ins> had changed. All American motor companies joined the muscle car frenzy, and the Chevelle continued to be a class leader. Big-blocks we're no longer a "big deal" and engine size this year was up to 427ci. Chevrolet began spitting out drag strip ready cars directly from its assembly lines. Springs got stiffer, gear ratios got closer and carburetor <dfn = "Cubic Feet per Minute">CFM's</dfn> got out of control.
The body style changed heavily during this generation, as the Chevelle saw an increase in overall length and wheelbase. The 1970 model year pulled out all the stops, putting big truck like displacement within a midsized car, the Chevelle had been given a 454ci behemoth. The "race everybody" complex died for all manufacturers 3 years later. The Federal Government and EPA cracked down hard on all manufacturers; it was time for a change.
By 1973, the Chevelle didn't even resemble itself from just the year before - in both appearance and performance (a lack of such). The Muscle car era saw a lot of insane achievements through its short timespan, and the Chevelle played a major role as it fought for the pride of Chevrolet.</p>
