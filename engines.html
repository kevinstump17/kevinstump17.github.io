<p>The Chevrolet 192ci is the smallest inline 6 cylinder they have ever made a "firebreathing" 120 horsepower. The 194 had been used in their truck division for decades, and its constant improvements kept it in use. A rarity among car collectors today, as many we're junked for more displacement.</p>

<p>327's were the largest motor available in '64-'65 (Except for the Unicorn like Z-16). Most small block Chevy engines resemble each other very closely in many ways, but a 327 can be identified by its unique oil breather/fill tube (Can be seen in chrome above). The 327 was ran in smaller numbers than more common 350's and 396's, paired with their ability for immense power and high-revving capability, they are highly sought after today.</p>

<p>The behemoth of the GM line of the 70's was the legendary 454. The displacement has been used across many truck platforms, and thus produces insane results when used in a midsize car. Despite heavy changes to induction and electrical componets with advancements in technology, the 454 is still in use today in large trucks, SUV's and cars such as the Corvette.</p>
